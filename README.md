### Movement artifacts and movement induced activity in EEG hyperscanning research
#### Development and assessment of a computational approach based on video recordings





This repository contains the programs to select ROIs, decode motion from H.264 files as well as the Scripts and Jupyter notebooks with the analysis of EEGs and movement. It serves the purpose of documentation and does not include the source data (Videos, EEGs and ROIs). Notebooks may be opened directly on this website. For each of them there is an html-printout.


- Pyvimo Viewer: 
A tool to define regions of interest, decode motion and automatically compute 1D or 2D representations.


- Dense Flow Decoder: 
A tool to decode H.264 motion vectors and save them as a dense vectorfield for each frame in H.264 format


- Case study Rock Paper Scissors: 
The analysis of a highly structured experiment that confirms the approach captures meaningful movement curves and shows how cross correlation may be employed. Besides analysis of ICA compontents is contained.


- Case study infant with substantial movement:
The analysis of a period with substantial movement that shows correlations of movement and band power. Besides analysis of ICA components is contained.


- Comparison of dense optical flow:
Qualitative and quantitative investigation of differences and similarities between dense optical flow vectors retrieved using different techniques.

- Movement synchrony: Analysis of differences of movement synchrony between conditions.
